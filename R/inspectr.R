#' inspectr: A package for performing fidelity checks on messy dataframes.
#'
#' The inspectr package contains two classes of functions: column checks and
#' basic fidelity checks.
#'
#' @section Column check functions: These are the basic functions used to
#'   perform checks. Each function checks one column for data fidelity, and
#'   functions exist to check that column against one or two additional columns.
#'   A data frame and a column name (or names) go in; a filtered set of records
#'   exhibiting issues comes out (either as a dataframe or as an .xlsx document
#'   - your choice!)
#'
#' @section Basic fidelity checks: These functions are designed to be used with
#'   the column check functions. They perform basic checks on the data, like
#'   ensuring that all data in a column are of the same type or ensuring that all
#'   values in column 1 are less than their corresponding values in column 2.
